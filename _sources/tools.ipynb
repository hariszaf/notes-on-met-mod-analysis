    " integration of thermodynamic information in metabolic models to assess the feasibility of flux distributions by thermodynamic driving forces. Here we present OptMDFpathway, a method that extends the recently proposed framework of Max-min Driving Force (MDF) for thermodynamic pathway analysis. Given a metabolic network model, OptMDFpathway identifies both the optimal MDF for a desired phenotypic behavior as well as the respective pathway itself that supports the optimal driving force. OptMDFpathway is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and is applicable to genome-scale metabolic networks. \n",
