    "COMETS includes the capability to simulate reactions happening in the extracellular environment, without association to a specific organism. \n",
    "Users can implement either elementary reactions of arbitrary order based on mass-action kinetics, or enzyme-catalyzed reactions obeying Michaelisâ€“Menten kinetics, \n",
    "e.g., for the simulation of extracellular enzymes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracellular reactions are present in some microbial communities owing to the activity of secreted extracellular enzymes. \n",
    "They can also represent feed-back loops in systems like a plant's root. \n",

    "For an example have a look at this [COMETS protocol](https://github.com/segrelab/COMETS_Protocols/tree/master/COMETS_protocols/COMETS_example_Extracellular_Reactions/Matlab).\n",
